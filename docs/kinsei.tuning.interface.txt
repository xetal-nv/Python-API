NOTE: This document describes the tuning interface available in trackingserver July2017 and newer only.

The kinsei system allows one single tuning client (at a time) to be connected to a secondary port specified in the config file (command CONFIG_SERVERPORT)
 
The protocol is completely custom and it accepts a first byte in order to discern the kind of message followed by other info if required.
The system will answer with a message that starts with the same byte followed by the required info.
 
IMPORTANT:  All values are to be given and are receoved multiplier by a factor 100 and represented over two bytes (unsigned shorts)
            Odd commands are used to get variables. Even commands are used to set variables

Command:
    Direction
    command code
    Direction
    message (in bytes)
