The KINSEI system is continuously listening on all the ip addresses of the host machine on the port specified inside the room.conf file.

In order to communicate with it, a tcp connection can be used and the following commands (only) will be accepted. Any other command will result in a generic error.

IMPORTANT: all position values must be divided by 10 to get the float number

Command:
    Direction
    command code

Number Of Persons (float number)
    Client -> KINSEI
    0x6E
    KINSEI -> Client

Persons Position (it is independent from the number of persons but if different (fixed one) it will fallback after a while)
    Client -> KINSEI
    0x64
    KINSEI -> Client
    0x64 #positions(1) {index(2) X(2) Y(2)}*#positions (when a position is not valid the index will be 0xffff)
